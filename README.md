# **Encryptor**

Encryptor is a small dotnet console application that can be used for converting strings to Base64 encoded strings and also to decode Base64 strings to normal string value.

The application can be useful when developers tend to store / configure application secrets in Base64 encoded strings and relying on any 3rd party app is not feasible
